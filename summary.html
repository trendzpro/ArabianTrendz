It emphasizes the critical features managers must understand to successfully implement information systems, including organizational structure, culture, and processes. The chapter discusses various strategic models, such as Porter’s competitive forces model and the value chain model, which guide firms in developing competitive advantages through technology. It highlights the challenges posed by strategic information systems, such as sustaining competitive advantages and aligning IT with business objectives. Real-world case studies, including GE and the NBA, illustrate these concepts in practice, showcasing how organizations can leverage information technology to enhance efficiency and competitiveness.</p>

            <h2 class="fade-in">Organizational Structure and Efficiency</h2>
            <p class="fade-in">The hierarchical structure of organizations is crucial for accountability and decision-making. Efficient organizations develop routines and processes that streamline operations, but changing these established elements can be challenging.</p>
